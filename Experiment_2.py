1. Declare these variables (x, y and z) as integers. Assign a value of 9 to x, Assign 
a value of 7 to y, perform addition, multiplication, division and subtraction on 
these two variables and Print out the result.
'''

x = 9
y = 7
z=0

print("x + y", x + y)
print("x * y", x * y)
print("x / y", x / y)  # For float division
print("x - y", x - y)
